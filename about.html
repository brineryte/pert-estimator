            <h2>What is the PERT method?</h2>
            <p>Time estimation. It's somtehing we're often required to do as programmers, but it's not necessarily something we're always good at. Indeed, many of us quote time without any idea or comprehension of the problem at hand. Others will use a blanket time estimate like the famous "2 weeks" catchall. But, this often renders poor results. Either the estimate is way off, missing the deadline and undermining your trustworthiness or taking only a day when the customer was expecting (and may have already paid for) 2 weeks. This is what makes the Program Evaluation and Review Technique or PERT method very useful.</p>

            <h3>The Method</h3>
            <p>The premise of this method is simple and addresses the problem of accuracy in time estimation. First, our estimates should take into account, several possible cases. For this, we'll consider 3: Best Case, Nominal Case, and Worst Case. We also need to allow some variance in our estimate. An estimate of "Four o'clock on Friday" is very precise, but it's also extremely difficult to meet. We want to give ourselves a larger target that will gurantee the successful fulfillment of the estimate. So instead of "Four o'clock Friday", we can say "This will be done Friday, give or take a day". This communicates that Thursday and Monday are possible completion dates and should be regarded as equally viable and acceptable as the Friday target.</p>
